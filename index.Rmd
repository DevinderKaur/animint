Animint Tutorial
========================================================

This tutorial is designed to demonstrate animint, a package that converts ggplot2 plots into d3 javascript graphics. Animint allows you to make interactive web-based graphics using familiar R methods. In addition, animint allows graphics to be animated and respond to user clicks.

Let's start with a reasonably common comparison of distributions: two normal distributions with different centers, and a gamma distribution. 

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
library(animint)
library(plyr)

boxplotdata <- rbind(data.frame(x=1:50, y=sort(rnorm(50, 3, 1)), group="N(3,1)"),
                     data.frame(x=1:50, y=sort(rnorm(50, 0, 1)), group="N(0,1)"), 
                     data.frame(x=1:50, y=sort(rgamma(50, 2, 1/3)), group="Gamma(2,1/3)"))
boxplotdata <- ddply(boxplotdata, .(group), transform, ymax=max(y), ymin=min(y), med=median(y))

g1 <- ggplot() + geom_density(data=boxplotdata, aes(x=y, group=group, fill=group), alpha=.5) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Distribution") + xlab("x") + 
  ggtitle("geom_density")
g1
gg2animint(list(plot1 = g1), out.dir="./g1")
```

You can see the resulting d3 plot [here](g1/index.html).

Animint requires a list of named plots - each plot must be a ggplot2 object and must have a name, such as "plot1" in the example above. You can also specify the output directory - this allows you to control where the generated webpage is stored. If the output directory is not specified, then typically R will create a temporary directory on your computer to store the generated webpage.
