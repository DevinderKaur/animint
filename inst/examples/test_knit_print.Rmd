```{r plot1top}
library(ggplot2) 
library(animint)
dat <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10, col = rep(c("a178", "b934"), 5))
q2 <- list(q = qplot(x, y, data = dat, colour = col, 
                     xlab = "first plot with color legend"))
structure(q2, class = "animint")
```

Clicking on the plot above should not affect the plot below.

```{r plot1bottom}
q1 <- list(q = qplot(x, y, data = dat, colour = col, 
                     xlab = "second plot with color legend"))
structure(q1, class = "animint")
```

The plot below has no interactive features.

```{r boring}
boring <- list(q = qplot(rnorm(100), xlab = "non-interactive plot"))
structure(boring, class = "animint")
```
