stop with an error when stat_bin is used to put several clickSelects
or showSelected values in the same bin!

multiple selection? ex, if 1 bin contains multiple values of
clickSelects, then can we select all of the corresponding geoms? This
would require rewriting a substantial amount of JS code, so let's just
ignore this for the time being.

bugfix for animations: before, we assumed that the animation variable
takes values in 1..n, but now this is treated properly by looking at
the actual values.
