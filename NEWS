TODOs in approximate order of importance (higher is more important).

facets -- would be useful when we want to align axes in related plots,
e.g. the last plot of examples/intreg.R. To implement facets it may be
useful to use "margin convention" http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563

coord_equal -- would be useful for maps e.g. examples/Tornadoes.R.

Include SEVERAL d3 plots directly in knitr html output e.g.
http://zvfak.blogspot.jp/2013/08/using-javascript-visualization.html

gg2gist(L) uploads animint as a gist to github.

BUG: when there are commas in text labels, animint.js does not parse
the CSV correctly. See examples/align_rect_text.R.

Render a <select> for each selector variable, so long lists
like this are not necessary.
https://github.com/vdimarco/dojo1/blob/master/hocking-canada-cities-viz.R

Why doesn't animation work in the last plot of this example?

Speedy downloading: on compile, divide data into chunks --- separate
csv files. In general a chunk of data will be shown onscreen at the
same time, but we should not make chunks with only 1 row e.g. for the
WorldBank viz, geom_points should have 1 chunk per year, geom_text
country labels should have 1 chunk per country, and geom_text year
labels should have just 1 chunk which covers all years. On page load,
start downloading the first chunk for each geom. After a chunk
finishes downloading, start downloading the next chunk for that geom,
until all data is loaded, even if it is not needed on screen right
now. Also, start downloading a chunk if we click on an unloaded subset
that we need to show.  E.g. for geom_point start downloading the
year=1960 chunk, then the year=1961 chunk, but then if we clicked on
year=2000, download that one immediately and set the next chunk in the
queue as year=2001.

Download progress table at the bottom of the plot.
- click a button to show or hide the entire table.
- starts shown, hides itself when everything is loaded.
- row for every geom.
- at least 3 columns: geom, total chunks, downloaded chunks.

Why does it take so much memory to compile large data? e.g.
examples/vervet.R.

Profile gg2animint() to see what part is slow, and speed it up!

Test SVG output after applying JavaScript? Is there some way we can
apply the JavaScript non-interactively and then check the results?
http://phantomjs.org/

theme(legend.position)

specify scale_x_continuous(LABEL) instead of xlab(LABEL).

aes(tooltip=text) for specifying the text to show when you hover the
mouse over something, e.g. issue #1.

layout=matrix of plot names means render plots in an html table
instead of in a line.

multiple selection/brushing? ex, if 1 bin contains multiple values of
clickSelects, then can we select all of the corresponding geoms? This
would require rewriting a substantial amount of JS code, so let's just
ignore this for the time being.

specify id or key variable for transitions? In the current set of
examples, using keys has proven un-necessary. So let's just ignore
this for now.  http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/

customizable alpha/color/size/etc for mouseovered/selected geoms. One
way to do this is by defining new *.hover aesthetics,
e.g. https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis/blob/master/demo/hover.r Another
way to do something similar is to just use
e.g. geom_point(aes(clickSelects=var))+
geom_point(aes(showSelected=var), colour="red", size=5)
Could we create a make_selecter() shortcut that does this?

gg2shiny(ggList) renders the interactive animation as a shiny app, e.g.
https://github.com/tdhock/interactive-tutorial/tree/master/animation/WorldBank

Is it possible to fix geom_rect and geom_text alignment? The
underlying problem is that there is no equivalent of R's vjust in SVG
(the equivalent of R's hjust=0.5|1|0 is CSS text-anchor:
middle|end|start). See examples/align_rect_text.R.

2014.2.24

vervet data.

2014.01.27

allow specifying guide="none" in ggplot2 scales that would generate a
legend.

2013.11.22

Test for warnings.

Warn when 0-sized geoms are produced, since they will be invisible.

Do not sort NULL during check for animation values, to avoid warning.

2013.11.19

draw colored, sized "a" in legend for geom_text.

geom_text(aes(size)) is resized using e.g. <text font-size="10">

2013.11.15

Bugfix: filter NaN before passing data to lineThing to avoid hiding an
entire line if only one element is NA.

2013.10.23

Include 1 animint in a knitr Rmd document when processed in the same
directory.

Generate documentation example web site.

Bugfix for geom_point(colour=constant).

2013.10.15

Hide only y axis and not x axis if axis.text.y=element_blank(), etc.

2013.10.4

Bugfixes for geom_ribbon(aes(fill=variable)) and
geom_text(aes(color=variable)).

2013.9.26

Update R/JS comments from emails to Susan.

gg2animint examples are animated and interactive.

2013.8.29
Implementation of geom_hex with relevant examples and documentation.

2013.8.15
Updated package requirements (MASS, reshape2, maps)
Updated documentation to include warnings about using google chrome with animint


2013.7.29
Fix for significant digits issue with clickSelects - fixed by exporting 
as character into JSON file, then importing and converting to numerals.

Axes can now be removed for maps

2013.7.26

bugfix for animations: before, we assumed that the animation variable
takes values in 1..n, but now this is treated properly by looking at
the actual values.

make_text for quick labels.

make_*(data, ...)

WARNING when stat_bin is used to put several clickSelects or
showSelected values in the same bin!
