TODOs in approximate order of importance (higher is more important).

BUG: make_text does not work if it appears before/after certain other
data... why? See examples/make_text_bug.R

BUG: geom_segment(aes(group=var)) will not be parsed correctly by
animint.js!

BUG: when there are commas in text labels, animint.js does not parse
the CSV correctly. See examples/align_rect_text.R.

BUG: Why doesn't animation work in the last plot of this example?

customizable alpha/color/size/fill/linetype for selected geoms, using
selected.alpha, selected.color, etc aesthetics, see
examples/Climate-selected.R. The first implementation should only
allow this at the geom level,
e.g. geom_point(aes(clickSelects=var),selected.color="red") means to
plot a bunch of points which are black if not selected and red if
selected. In ggplot2-0.9.3.1, selected.color thus defined can be
accessed as layer$stat_params$selected.color. In the future we can try
an implementation at the aes level,
e.g. geom_point(aes(clickSelects=var1,selected.color=var2)) means
black if not selected and scale[var2] if selected. NOTE: should
maintain compatibility with existing code, which assumes
selected.color="black" and color="transparent" for
e.g. geom_rect(aes(fill=numeric, clickSelects=id)) and otherwise,
selected.alpha=1 and alpha=1/2.

Custom titles for the generated HTML page.

Include SEVERAL d3 plots directly in knitr html output e.g.
http://zvfak.blogspot.jp/2013/08/using-javascript-visualization.html

gg2gist(L) uploads animint as a gist to github.

facets -- would be useful when we want to align axes in related plots,
e.g. the last plot of examples/intreg.R. To implement facets it may be
useful to use "margin convention" http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563

coord_equal -- would be useful for maps e.g. examples/Tornadoes.R.

Render a <select> for each selector variable, so long lists
like this are not necessary.
https://github.com/vdimarco/dojo1/blob/master/hocking-canada-cities-viz.R

OPTION: after clicking and changing the displayed data subset,
zoom/update the axes of related plots. For animations we clearly want
to keep the same axes across animation frames, but for some other
kinds of plots it would be nice if the axes automatically zoomed. Make
this an option list axesZoom=list(plotXY=c("x", "y"), plotX="x") means
that the x axis should be updated for plotX and both axes should be
updated for plotXY, but the axes are NOT updated for any other
plots. There should also be a button next to each axis that you can
click to toggle zooming on and off.

It would be nice to be able to resize plots interactively, like we can
do in shiny.

Speedy downloading: on compile, divide data into chunks --- separate
csv files. In general a chunk of data will be shown onscreen at the
same time, but we should not make chunks with only 1 row e.g. for the
WorldBank viz, geom_points should have 1 chunk per year, geom_text
country labels should have 1 chunk per country, and geom_text year
labels should have just 1 chunk which covers all years. On page load,
start downloading the first chunk for each geom. After a chunk
finishes downloading, start downloading the next chunk for that geom,
until all data is loaded, even if it is not needed on screen right
now. Also, start downloading a chunk if we click on an unloaded subset
that we need to show.  E.g. for geom_point start downloading the
year=1960 chunk, then the year=1961 chunk, but then if we clicked on
year=2000, download that one immediately and set the next chunk in the
queue as year=2001.

It would probably reduce disk space and file transfer times if we used
separate CSV files for different showSelected values, and deleted the
showSelected column(s) in the CSV files.

Download progress table at the bottom of the plot.
- click a button to show or hide the entire table.
- starts shown, hides itself when everything is loaded.
- row for every geom.
- at least 3 columns: geom, total chunks, downloaded chunks.

Why does it take so much memory to compile large data? e.g.
examples/vervet.R.

Profile gg2animint() to see what part is slow, and speed it up!

Test SVG output after applying JavaScript? Is there some way we can
apply the JavaScript non-interactively and then check the results?
http://phantomjs.org/ or in R http://www.omegahat.org/SpiderMonkey/

theme(legend.position)

specify scale_x_continuous(LABEL) instead of xlab(LABEL).

aes(tooltip=text) for specifying the text to show when you hover the
mouse over something, e.g. issue #1.

layout=matrix of plot names means render plots in an html table
instead of in a line.

multiple selection/brushing? ex, if 1 bin contains multiple values of
clickSelects, then can we select all of the corresponding geoms? This
would require rewriting a substantial amount of JS code, so let's just
ignore this for the time being.

specify id or key variable for transitions? In the current set of
examples, using keys has proven un-necessary. So let's just ignore
this for now.  http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/

gg2shiny(ggList) renders the interactive animation as a shiny app, e.g.
https://github.com/tdhock/interactive-tutorial/tree/master/animation/WorldBank

Is it possible to fix geom_rect and geom_text alignment? The
underlying problem is that there is no equivalent of R's vjust in SVG
(the equivalent of R's hjust=0.5|1|0 is CSS text-anchor:
middle|end|start). See examples/align_rect_text.R.

theme(animint.width=600, animint.height=600) instead of option lists
which make us repeat the plot names... this results in an error with
ggplot2-0.9.3.1, is there any work-around or do we need to just
continue to use option lists?

2014.3.19

For geoms with fill=a numeric variable, changing the opacity changes
how we interpret the colors, so for these geoms, show selection by
changing the stroke instead.

2014.3.13

scale_size_animint

2014.2.24

vervet data.

2014.01.27

allow specifying guide="none" in ggplot2 scales that would generate a
legend.

2013.11.22

Test for warnings.

Warn when 0-sized geoms are produced, since they will be invisible.

Do not sort NULL during check for animation values, to avoid warning.

2013.11.19

draw colored, sized "a" in legend for geom_text.

geom_text(aes(size)) is resized using e.g. <text font-size="10">

2013.11.15

Bugfix: filter NaN before passing data to lineThing to avoid hiding an
entire line if only one element is NA.

2013.10.23

Include 1 animint in a knitr Rmd document when processed in the same
directory.

Generate documentation example web site.

Bugfix for geom_point(colour=constant).

2013.10.15

Hide only y axis and not x axis if axis.text.y=element_blank(), etc.

2013.10.4

geom_text(aes(color=variable)).

2013.9.26

Update R/JS comments from emails to Susan.

gg2animint examples are animated and interactive.

2013.8.29
Implementation of geom_hex with relevant examples and documentation.

2013.8.15
Updated package requirements (MASS, reshape2, maps)

Fix for significant digits issue with clickSelects - fixed by exporting 
as character into JSON file, then importing and converting to numerals.

Axes can now be removed for maps

2013.7.26

bugfix for animations: before, we assumed that the animation variable
takes values in 1..n, but now this is treated properly by looking at
the actual values.

make_text for quick labels.

make_*(data, ...)

WARNING when stat_bin is used to put several clickSelects or
showSelected values in the same bin!
